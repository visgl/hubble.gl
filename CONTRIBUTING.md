## Contributing to hubble.gl

**Thanks for taking the time to contribute!**

PRs and bug reports are welcome, and we are actively looking for new maintainers.

## Setting Up Dev Environment

The **master** branch is the active development branch.

Building Hubble.gl locally from the source requires node.js `>=10`.
We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to manage the dependencies.

```bash
# 1. Clone your fork of the hubble.gl repository
git clone git git@github.com:<github username>/hubble.gl.git

# 2. Move to the directory where you put hubble.gl
cd hubble.gl

# 3. Add the main repository as an upstream remote
git remote add upstream "git@github.com:visgl/hubble.gl.git"

# 4. Change to the master branch if not already on it (starts on master by default)
git checkout master

# 5. Installs JavaScript dependencies
yarn

# 6. Installs other JavaScript dependencies
yarn bootstrap

# 7. Tests to make sure install went smoothly
yarn test

# 8. Hubble.gl is intended for use with mapbox https://www.mapbox.com/
export MapboxAccessToken=<your_access_token_here>

# 9. Start up hubble.gl example project
# Optional: cd to a directory within the examples folder. If you do, repeat step 5 before doing this next step
yarn start-local
```
