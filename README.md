- **High Quality Video:** 60+fps framerates, up to 8k resolution, and a variety of formats. Render a quick draft or with loseless encoding. Fine tune timing and look with keyframe markers and render everything in the same app.

- **Easy Integration:** Define animations for deck.gl or kepler.gl features, then render videos. Integrate with React UI components to interact with animation and rendering settings.

- **Client Side Library:** Videos render and encode directly in the web browser. User data never leaves their machine. Since nothing runs on a server, sites can scale without computation costs.
